Image classification is the task of assigning a label or a category to an input image. It
is a fundamental problem in computer vision, and it has many applications in various
fields. Support Vector Machines (SVM) is one of the popular algorithms used for
image classification. SVM is a machine learning algorithm that can be used for both
classification and regression tasks. It has shown promising results in many
applications, including image classification. In this report, we will discuss how SVM
can be used for image classification in Python.
Wavelet transform can be used in image classification tasks by extracting relevant
features from an image at multiple scales. The wavelet transform decomposes an
image into multiple levels of frequency sub-bands, which contain information about
different aspects of the image such as edges, textures, and smooth regions.
There are several libraries that can be used for wavelet transform and image
classification. One popular library for wavelet transform is PyWavelets, and for image
classification, we can use scikit-learn.
The project will involve the following steps:
Data collection: We will collect a dataset of images that are to be classified.
Data pre-processing: We will pre-process the images to extract relevant features
using OpenCV.
Training the SVM classifier: We will train an SVM classifier using the extracted
features from the training dataset.
Testing the classifier: We will test the performance of the SVM classifier on a test
dataset.
Evaluation: We will evaluate the performance of the SVM classifier by analyzing its
accuracy and confusionÂ matrix.
